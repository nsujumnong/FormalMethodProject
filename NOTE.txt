This folder contains MATLAB scripts and functions for the Formal Method project

Most of the codes and scripts are the modification of Radian and Yan's original codes for PSM and MTM parameter identification and dynamic model analysis

The "divided by zero" error when running Flow* comes from Interval.cpp 
try checking the code or see where the function is called for debugging.
